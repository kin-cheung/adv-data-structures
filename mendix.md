# Mendix
This page contains personal opinions of Menfix after spending some time with the technology with absolutely no prior knowledge of the product.

## Strengths
 - intuitive and user-friendly IDE (Mendix Studio Pro)
   - auto page generation
   - intelligent auto field type selection
   - WYSIWYG design editor
   - refactoring capability across all component types
 - various levels of access controls configurable through IDE (module, page, field, entity, data (XPATH) level) using RBAC
 - PAAS for demo and testing purposes with single-click deployments from IDE (via "publish")

## Weaknesses
 - monolith by design (frontend and backend are lightly coupled)
 - a small learn curve is required, even for software engineers
 - not suitable for pure business users with no programming knowledge
 - customising widgets is possible, but it will require frontend development skills and might lower the maintainability of the application

## What mendix is good for
 - perfect for internal enterprise applications where scalability and performance are not as important due to its monolith design
