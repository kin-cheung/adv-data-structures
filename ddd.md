# Domain Driven Design

## Event Storming

## Bounded Context
 - a piece of software where rules, definitions and models are consistently (but not always) applied
 - a developer should know easily if they are outside or inside of it (e.g. deployment boundary, database boundary, etc)
 - a team often own an entire boundary and they have to agree on the design, architecture and process
 - a way to bring legacy systems back to life with new ubiquitous languages to meet current business

### Ubiquitous langage
 - a common lanaguage within a boundary
 - not meant to be agreed by others outside of the boundary
 - only agreements on the interfaces are required
 - meant to be changed as the business changes

### Motivations
 - language in context
 - focused models
 - clear stewardship
 - islands of order (the outside world can be messy)
